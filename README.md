# CV-site

# What you need
<<<<<<< HEAD
You will need a database to store you projects and possibly your news/blog posts, the database is going to be created in db/ but you will need to populate it with the build in functions or your own way
=======
projects.py file where you store your projects and info about them, for an example:
```
projects = [

		{
	   'title': 'Website',
       'github': 'https://github.com/Alfredsson418/CV-site',
	   'p': 'This website',
	   'color': 'rgb(75, 100, 200)',
	   'done' : 'Ongoing'
	}
]
```
